  <h1>Security Safeguards</h1>

  <p>GroupHub takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. We want the information that you submit to us to be secure. We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect our Site and Services, as well as the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We have also implemented robust access controls to safeguard against unauthorized access to our information systems. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.</p>
  <p>There are also certain steps you should take to safeguard your account and information. For example, you should select a secure password that only you know, and should always sign out of your account when finished. It is your responsibility to protect the confidentiality of your password in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account and password. You should immediately change your password and notify us if you discover or suspect any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
  <p>When our registration imports sensitive information such as date of birth, home address and social security number, that information is encrypted using SSL. During this process, the user creates a username and password that establishes their account. Once the account is established, users must log on to update their profile, place orders or review account status - all of which are done on secure pages. While on a secure page, such as the registration or 'My Account' page, the icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer will show a 'locked' status.</p>
  <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific function&mdash;such as customer support&mdash;are granted access to personally identifiable information.</p>
